## Description
This Python program processes sensor data, organizes readings, calculates statistics, and provides options to analyze the data. It handles temperature, stress, and displacement readings from different sensors over time.

The program provides the following functionalities:

1. Organize readings per sensor.
2. Identify unique sensors with extreme values.
3. Compare readings from different time intervals.
4. Summarize data by calculating max, min, and average readings per sensor.
5. Group data by sensor.
6. Use sets to find unique sensor IDs that recorded stress > 13.0.
7. Calculate statistics per sensor.
8. Find max, min, and average temperature and max displacement.
9. Extract and sort timestamps.
10. Create a tuple of the most recent reading for each sensor.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python sensor_data_analysis.py
   ```
3. The program will prompt you to choose an option from the menu.
4. Select an option to perform the corresponding analysis.
5. Continue the analysis or exit as required.

## Options
- Option 1: Organize readings per sensor
- Option 2: Identify unique sensors with extreme values (highest and lowest temperature)
- Option 3: Compare readings from different time intervals
- Option 4: Summarize the data by calculating max, min, and average readings per sensor
- Option 5: Group data by sensor using a dictionary
- Option 6: Find unique sensor IDs with stress > 13.0
- Option 7: Calculate statistics for each sensor
- Option 8: Calculate max, min, and average temperature and max displacement
- Option 9: Extract and sort timestamps
- Option 10: Show the most recent reading for each sensor

## Requirements
This program requires Python 3.x. Ensure you have the necessary version installed.
